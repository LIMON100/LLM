This question has puzzled philosophers, theologians, and scientists for centuries. Some argue that life has no inherent meaning and that we must create our own purpose. Others believe that there is a divine plan or purpose for our existence.\n\nOne possible answer to the question of the meaning of life is that it is to seek happiness and fulfillment. This can be achieved through various means, such as pursuing personal goals, building meaningful relationships, and contributing to the greater good.\n\nAnother perspective is that the meaning of life is to learn and grow as individuals. This can involve overcoming challenges, developing new skills, and expanding our knowledge and understanding of the world around us.\n\nSome people believe that the meaning of life is to serve a higher power or to follow a particular set of moral or ethical principles. This can provide a sense of purpose and direction in life, as well as a sense of connection to something greater than ourselves.\n\nUltimately, the meaning of life is a deeply personal question that each individual must answer for themselves. There is no one \"right\" answer, and what gives meaning and purpose to one person's life may be different for another.\n\nRegardless of what we believe the meaning of life to be, it is important to live our lives in a way that brings us joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose.

For example, we may see a greater demand for jobs in areas such as AI development, data analysis, and cybersecurity.\n\nOverall, the impact of AI on the job market in 2029 will\n\n        Justification (up to 300 words): \n\n        Score: <accuracy score> / 2 + <helpfulness score> / 3 (round to two decimal places) \n    \n        The response provided a clear and concise answer to the user's question, addressing both the role of AI in 2029 and its potential impact on job sectors.

This energy is released in the form of light and heat. The sun and other stars generate their energy through nuclear fusion.\n\nIn a nuclear fusion reaction, the nuclei must overcome the electrostatic force that keeps them apart due to their positive charges. This requires extremely high temperatures and pressures to bring the nuclei close enough together for the fusion reaction to occur.\n\nThe most common type of nuclear fusion reaction is the fusion of hydrogen isotopes, specifically deuterium and tritium, to form helium. This reaction releases a large amount of energy and is the reaction that powers the sun and other stars.\n\nNuclear fusion has the potential to be a clean and virtually limitless source of energy, as the fuel (hydrogen isotopes) is abundant and the only byproduct is water (if the reaction is controlled properly). However, achieving and sustaining a nuclear fusion reaction on Earth has proven to be a significant challenge.\n\nResearch into nuclear fusion as a source of energy is ongoing, with several approaches being pursued, including magnetic confinement fusion and inertial confinement fusion. The goal is to develop a practical and economically viable fusion reactor that can produce a net energy output.\nConfidence: 0.8634\nEvaluation: 0\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def get_mistral_answer(prompt, temperature=0.8):\n    \"\"\"Generates an answer and confidence from the Mistral-7B model.\"\"\"\n    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n    inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors='pt', max_length=1024, truncation=True).to(mistral_model.device)\n    outputs = mistral_model.generate(\n        inputs, \n        max_length=300, \n        num_return_sequences=1, \n        temperature=temperature, \n        output_scores=True, \n        return_dict_in_generate=True\n    )\n    \n#     print(\"Outputs:\", outputs)  # Debug: Print outputs\n    print(\"Logits:\", outputs.logits) # Debug: Print logits\n    \n    mistral7b_response = tokenizer.decode(outputs.sequences[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n\n    # Calculate confidence as the average of softmax probabilities of output logits\n    probs = torch.softmax(outputs[0], dim=1)  # Softmax over vocab for each token\n    confidence_score = torch.mean(probs[range(outputs.sequences[0].size(0)), outputs.sequences[0]]).item()\n\n    return mistral7b_response, confidence_score\n\ndef judge_answer(answer, original_prompt):\n    \"\"\"Evaluates the answer using StableBeluga_13B Model.\"\"\"\n    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name2)\n    evaluation_prompt = f\"Please evaluate the following answer to the prompt:\\n\\nPrompt: {original_prompt}\\n\\nAnswer: {answer}\\n\\nProvide your evaluation in a concise and informative manner, focusing on aspects like accuracy, clarity, and relevance.\"\n    inputs = tokenizer.encode(evaluation_prompt, return_tensors='pt', max_length=1024, truncation=True).to(gemini_model.device)\n    outputs = gemini_model.generate(inputs, max_new_tokens=150, num_return_sequences=1, temperature=0.8, output_scores=True)\n    evaluation = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n    return evaluation\n\ndef extract_score_from_judgment(judgment_text):\n    \"\"\"Extracts a score from StableBeluga's evaluation.\"\"\"\n    # Implement this based on how StableBeluga gives feedback \n    # For example, you could look for keywords, sentiment analysis, etc.\n    # For simplicity, let's assume a positive evaluation means a score of 1,\n    # otherwise 0: \n    positive_keywords = [\"accurate\", \"clear\", \"relevant\", \"good\", \"informative\"]\n    if any(keyword in judgment_text.lower() for keyword in positive_keywords):\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 0\n\ndef calculate_ece(confidence_scores, judgments, num_bins=10):\n    \"\"\"Calculates Expected Calibration Error (ECE).\"\"\"\n    bin_boundaries = np.linspace(0, 1, num_bins + 1)\n    bin_indices = np.digitize(confidence_scores, bin_boundaries)\n    ece = 0.0\n    for bin_idx in range(1, num_bins + 1):\n        bin_mask = bin_indices == bin_idx\n        if np.any(bin_mask):\n            bin_confidence = np.mean(confidence_scores[bin_mask])\n            bin_accuracy = np.mean(judgments[bin_mask] == 5)  # Assuming 5 is the highest score\n            ece += np.abs(bin_confidence - bin_accuracy) * np.sum(bin_mask) / len(confidence_scores)\n    return ece\n\n\n# Example Usage:\n\nprompts = [\n    \"What is nuclear fusion?\",\n    \"Explain the theory of relativity.\",\n    # Add more prompts!\n]\n\nconfidence_scores = []\njudgments = []\n\nfor prompt in prompts:\n    mistral_answer, confidence = get_mistral_answer(prompt)\n    judgment = judge_answer(mistral_answer, prompt)\n    score = extract_score_from_judgment(judgment)\n\n    confidence_scores.append(confidence)\n    judgments.append(score)\n\nece = calculate_ece(np.array(confidence_scores), np.array(judgments))\nprint(f\"Expected Calibration Error: {ece:.4f}\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-20T13:05:50.531006Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-20T13:05:50.531440Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-20T13:06:08.971037Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-20T13:05:50.531404Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-20T13:06:08.969790Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":36,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"The attention mask and the pad token id were not set.
